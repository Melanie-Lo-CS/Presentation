## Introdction
This program conatins JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, combined in one project. This program was inspired by a book my teacher gave me. It gave me a chance to enhance and give a better understanding of JavaScript. The idea of this program was to spread awareness of mental ilness, the most known ones (anxiety and depression). This idea was thought through the Technovation team of girls (Cup'O Java). We wanted to show support and demonstrate that these things actually happen. The program is still developing algorithms through videos, because it also gives the user a better chance at relating to this program. Although the program is not finished we would still like to show what we have done and maybe more ideas. We have been considering to bring this to Alberta Health Services because there may be some ideas that we can add into the program for our algorithm.

## Instructions
Even though the program isn't fully developed I will still explain the instructions of the program. The program will be developed into a game soon. The website includes a start button, and take a servey button. Pressing the "Take The Survey" button will take you to another page that is used to gather the users information, it is used as a broad understanding of how we care in a way and how this is also used as an algorithm. The "Start" button it will bring you to a page of videos and you get to choose what videos, you get to watch. Next after watching as many videos as you like there's a skip button in the left bottom corner to get you to play the "game". For now it is just a demonstartion of what JavaSCript looks like and what I learned.
