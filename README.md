## Introdction

Mental Health App is a program to spread awareness of mental illness. This code has been edited by the schools Girl's Technovation team (Cup'O Java), we have chose to code with CSS and HTML. We chose those three languages to make a an app, but so far we have made a website out of it with only HTML and CSS. The third language we have considered was JavaScript. The website itself is raw code. This program is something our team is continuing to develop for example the algorithms. We are looking forward to contact Alberta Health Services and our student services to get new ideas for this app and make it suitable for mobile and everyone to use!

## Purpose Of Program

This program is serving an understanding of Mental illness that some people struggle or suffer with. It's to spread awareness of how they're also humans just like every other person. The program is to bring understanding and how they're also not alone in their journey. In my personal life I struggle with anxiety, and I know other people are walking in a similar path. We wanna bring support and that they can do it. We wanna tell those people they're valuable and important just like any other person. In our society, my team and I wanna explain what mental illness does to a person and how they're affected by it. By doing this we have a survey that brings down to certain outcomes and different outcomes as well. 

## Algorithms and Abstraction

My algorithm has not been fully developed yet, I will however explain how my program is gonna work with it. The algorithm I am planning to create a pattern from the survey that shows certain outcomes of videos through what the user's answers are. The videos will be displayed of relatable content of the answers of the survey to make our program more compatible with the user at a level. There will be at least 5-10 videos of certain outcomes. 

My program is made up of abstractions.
*button code: <button class="button button1">Start</button>
*survey code: 
            First name; <input type="text" name="firstname"><br><br>
            Last name ; <input type="text" name="lastname"><br></br>

            Do you support those with a mental illness?<br><br>
            <input type="radio" name="button" value="Yes">Yes<br>
            <input type="radio" name="button" value="No">No<br></br>


## Data Issues or Difficulties

One of the things my team and I had difficulties with were implementing JavaScript to this program because we had a different engine for it and it was missing some files we could not solve. The other issue is how were going to collect data from the survey.
