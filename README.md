## Introdction
Mental Health App is a program to spread awareness of mental illness. This code has been edited by the schools Girl's Technovation team (Cup'O Java), we have chose to code with CSS and HTML. We chose those three languages to make a an app, but so far we have made a website out of it with only HTML and CSS. The third language we have considered was JavaScript. The website itself is raw code. This program is something our team is continuing to develop for example the algorithms. We are looking forward to contact Alberta Health Services and our student services to get new ideas for this app and make it suitable for mobile and everyone to use!
