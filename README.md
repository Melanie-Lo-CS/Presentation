## Introdction

Mental Health App is a program to spread awareness of mental illness and how people and others around get affected by it and also to help users know that they're not alone. This code has been edited by the schools Girl's Technovation team (Cup'O Java), we have chose to code with CSS and HTML. We chose those three languages to make an app, but so far we have made a website out of it with only HTML and CSS. The third language we have considered was JavaScript (we had issues). The website itself is made of raw code. My program runs locally on GitHub.

## Instructions

Specific instructions on how to download my program. 

* Download Chrome
* Download Atom through Chrome(only for code)
* Go to my GitHub repository in chrome, URL:(https://github.com/Melanie-Lo-CS/technovation)
* Download the zip from the download or clone button
* Show in folder after download
* Extract the file in your own file explorer
* The file then shows a Chrome icon, double click on the "project.html" chrome file to see main page
* Or right-click it and open with Atom to see raw code
* Have fun!

## Purpose Of Program

This program is serving an understanding of mental illness that some people struggle or suffer with. In my personal life I struggle with anxiety, and I know other people are walking in a similar path. We wanna bring support and that some people are here for those in need. In our society, my team and I wanna explain what mental illness does to a person and how they're affected by it. By doing this we have a survey that brings down to certain outcomes and different outcomes as well. We also want others to acknowledge their well-being because it can affect how those with mental illness feel and think. 

## Algorithms and Abstraction

My algorithm has not been fully developed yet, I will however explain how my program is gonna work with it. The algorithm I am planning to create is a pattern from the survey that shows certain outcomes of videos through what the user's answers are. The videos will be displayed of relatable content of the answers of the survey to make our program more compatible with the user at a level. There will be at least 5-10 videos of certain outcomes. 

My program is made up of abstractions like:
* buttons: 



              <button class="button button1">Start</button>
              
              
* a survey: 


            First name; <input type="text" name="firstname"><br><br>
            Last name ; <input type="text" name="lastname"><br></br>

            Do you support those with a mental illness?<br><br>
            <input type="radio" name="button" value="Yes">Yes<br>
            <input type="radio" name="button" value="No">No<br></br>


## Data Issues or Difficulties

One of the things my team and I had difficulties with were implementing JavaScript to this program because we had a different engine for it and it was missing some files we could not solve. The other issue is how were going to collect data from the survey. 

## Other Ideas

This is the engine we used to code with JavaScript. The program is shown is through this site https://code3dgames.com/3de/. This engine was going to be used as a game program within the web app.

We are still looking for ways to improve ths app to become modern and useful. We are looking forward to contact Alberta Health Services and our student services to get new ideas for this app and make it suitable for mobile and everyone to use!
